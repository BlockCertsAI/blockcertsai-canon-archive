MAIAi — Real-Time Behavioral Enforcement

MAIAi is the real-time security and behavioral enforcement engine within the Sovereign Substrate.
It ensures that every authenticated action — whether human, digital twin, application, or contract — operates within approved behavioral, jurisdictional, and policy boundaries.

Core Responsibilities
1. Real-Time Monitoring

MAIAi continuously evaluates:

user behavior

device context

workflow progression

sequence validity

anomaly signals

policy adherence

2. Behavioral Enforcement

MAIAi intervenes automatically to:

block prohibited actions

quarantine suspect activity

reroute workflows

require re-authentication

alert or escalate to The Architect

3. Compliance Reflexes

MAIAi applies “reflex-level” enforcement:

real-time AML/CTF triggers

contractual rule adherence

operational thresholds

jurisdictional constraints

fraud pattern detection

4. Support for Self-Healing

MAIAi works in tandem with The Architect, providing:

behavioral diagnostics

threat analytics

remediation signals

Outcome

MAIAi acts as the nervous system of the Sovereign Substrate — continuously sensing, evaluating, and enforcing correct behavior across identities, ADTs, nodes, workflows, and applications.
